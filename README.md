# Space-Invaders
Python Game 

## Description

Space Invaders is a classic arcade-style game built in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control a spaceship, represented by the player, and shoot down waves of enemy spaceships before they reach the bottom of the screen. 

## Features

- Intuitive controls: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player spaceship, and press the spacebar to shoot projectiles.
- Increasing difficulty: As the player progresses through levels, more enemy spaceships spawn, and they move faster.
- Real-time score tracking: Keep track of your score as you destroy enemy spaceships. Each successful hit earns you points.
- Lives system: The player starts with three lives. Losing a life occurs when an enemy spaceship crosses a dotted line at the bottom of the screen or collides with the player's spaceship.
- Game over and victory conditions: The game ends when the player runs out of lives (game over) or successfully completes all levels (victory).
